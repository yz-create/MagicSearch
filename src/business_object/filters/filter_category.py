        The filter is applied along a categorical variable defined using the "variable_filtered" and
        a certain criterion depending on the "type_of_filtering" and the "filtering_value"

        Parameters
        ----------
        variable_filtered: str
            is a categorical variable chosen among the following :

        type_of_filtering: str
            defines the way we want to filter the variable.
            It can only take "positive" or "negative" as an input
            positive meaning that the filter will select all cards
            with a value in the variable_filtered equal to the filtering_value
            negative meaning that the filter will select all cards
            with a value in the variable_filtered different from the filtering_value

        filtering_value: str
            is the value (corresponding to the variable_filtered)
            we want to filter our database along

        returns
